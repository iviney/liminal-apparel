  <h1>ORGANIC</h1>  
  <p>
  Our raw materials are sourced from suppliers who use sustainable farming and production processes. This means
  they avoid the use of chemicals, hormones, and preservatives which damage the earth and are harmful to people.
  When pesticides and fertilizers are used to grow non-organic cotton there is an extraordinary impact on the
  earth and on those who work it. Thatâ€™s why Freeset sources 100% eco-cert organic cotton, and uses a 100% organic
  process for dyeing.
