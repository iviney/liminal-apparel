== Welcome to Liminal Apparel

Liminal Apparel is a website for selling T-shirts and other accessories.  It is
based on Spree, which uses Ruby on Rails.

== Notes

There are a couple of new rake commands:

  rake import:production
  rake export:development

These copy the production database to your local machine's development database,
and vice versa.
